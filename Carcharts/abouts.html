				This site has been created after our need to be able to see what diffirent cars can doaround a track,
				0-100, 0-200 and 0-300 and many more.
				The sites information about the cars are currently entered in manually by us, the creator of the site.
				In the future we plan on making this automated and to be updated on a daily basis with new cars.
				This of course also means that we don't currently have all the cars in the world on the site,
				but only a few specific ones.
